# Unity Audio Converter

I am working in a project that needs to record user's voice and apply filter on. The project use **NatCorder** to record. **NatCorder** is great but it has a problem with applying `Audio Mixer`. However, I see that using `Audio Filter` works well.

By taking the idea of `Audio Mixer`, I build this package to provide my team a tool to manage a list of `Audio Filter`s and generate it in run time.

It still has many bugs and lacks features. I will update it if necessary.

My package would be not useful to most of you. But anyway, have a nice day!
